# MC_GR_project
final project for advanced programming by Giacomo Rossato and Marcello capasso

The project was divided in two parts:

In the c++ folder, a custom templated binary search tree was implemented, tested and benchmarked against standard library's map in order to assess its performances. A short report is available in the same folder.
the files for the tree implementation are in the "include" and in the "src" directories, while the benchmark is in the time_test directory.

In the python folder, the PostcardList class was implemented to read and write postcard addresses on text files. The folder also contains the mandatory unit tests for the class and some files used to test it.
In the folder there are the ".py" file containing the unitest and the ".txt" files used by it.
